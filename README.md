# ledcontrol

Web interface for a WS2812 led matrix:
  - Driven by a Scanlime's Fadecandy board
  - Freely inspired by Supplyframe's "Fled" (thanks Hackaday.com :))
  - Made with Node.Js (on Visual Studio Code)
  - Running on a Raspberry Pi 2


Notes:
  - "pkginstall.sh" provides required packages for Node "canvas"
